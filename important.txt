If you're worried about bots, ... gathering info about you:
* with Github: 
  * set up a 2nd github account with a name not linking to you (over your email you'll see updates from the pages you subscribe to), or
* without giving Github any info: 
  * use a service that enables RSS feeds for the pages you want to be notified
