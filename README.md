# Gridcoin-tasks
tasks, wishes, ideas, ... for the [Gridcoin](https://gridcoin.us) project

The initial goal is:
* to identify mentioned tasks from the [Gridcoin hangouts](https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@cm-steem/gridcoin-community-hangout-episode-guide)

Later we'll see how we use this repo more, but:
* I've no problem when tasks from elsewhere ([the forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/forum/464-gridcoin-grc/), ...) are mentioned here also so they can be seen/managed better
* for those then, do this: 
  * create a task [here](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/issues), and 
   * do a short *summary*
   * *link* to the external place
   * make a possible *time estimate* for realization (e.g. on the issue page you can also set the milestone field)
   * *who* is or might be possible to realize/implement (e.g. on the issue page you can also set the assignees field)

Bugs obviously belong to the [Gridcoin bugtracker](https://github.com/gridcoin/Gridcoin-Research/issues)
* before reporting there, please search if it exists there already
