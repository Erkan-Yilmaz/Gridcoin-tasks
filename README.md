# Gridcoin-tasks
tasks, wishes, ideas, ... for the Gridcoin project

The initial goal is:
* to identify mentioned tasks from the [Gridcoin hangouts](https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@cm-steem/gridcoin-community-hangout-episode-guide)

Later we'll see how we use this repo more, but:
* I have no problem when tasks from elsewhere ([the forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/forum/464-gridcoin-grc/), ...) are moved to here so they can be seen/managed better

Bugs obviously belong to the [Gridcoin bugtracker](https://github.com/gridcoin/Gridcoin-Research/issues)
* before reporting there, please search if it exists there already
