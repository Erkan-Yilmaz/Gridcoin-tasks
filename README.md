How can you help ?
* Marketing tasks are probably the easiest startig point,
* but every other task also needs input: 
  * read them and comment your thoughts. Others will pick up from there

***

The initial goal is:
* to identify mentioned tasks from the [Gridcoin hangouts](https://steemit.com/gridcoin/@cm-steem/gridcoin-community-hangout-episode-guide) (see also: [minutes](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-hangout-minutes) of the hangouts)

Later we'll see how we use this repo more, but:
* there's no problem when tasks from elsewhere ([the forum](https://cryptocointalk.com/forum/464-gridcoin-grc/), ...) are mentioned here also so they can be seen/managed better.
* For those then, do this: 
  * create a task [here](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/issues) (click the green "New issue" button on the right), and 
   * do a short *summary* (really, our motto here is: *less is beautiful*)
   * *link* to the external place (there you can be more detailed ;-))
   * make a possible *time estimate* for realization (e.g. on the issue page you can also set the *milestone* field)
   * *who* is or might be possible to realize/implement (e.g. on the issue page you can also set the *assignees* field).
   * Using a category ([marketing](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/marketing), [bounty](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/bounty), [newcomers](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/newcomers), [wallet](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/wallet), [roadmap](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/roadmap), [exchanges](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/exchanges),...) for your issue is also possible (see [here](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels)). There can also be created new categories.

Bugs obviously belong to the [Gridcoin bugtracker](https://github.com/gridcoin/Gridcoin-Research/issues)
* e.g. most of the tasks in category: [wallet](https://github.com/Erkan-Yilmaz/Gridcoin-tasks/labels/wallet) will go there after more detailing, ...
* keep in mind: before reporting in the bugtracker, please search if your bug exists there already
